    "## About This Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll cover the basic Ray Core APIs and its fundamental patterns. This is an introductory material, covering three basic distributed Ray core APIs patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Remote Functions as Tasks\n",
    " * Remote Objects as Futures\n",
    " * Remote Classes as stateful Actors\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "There are other advanced [Ray Patterns and Anti-patterns](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-design-patterns/index.html), which are not covered in this tutorial. Mainly applicable when writing more complex distributed applications, we recommend reading them to equip yourself to use Ray APIs more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial also includes extra material on hyperparameter optimization and model serving with Ray libraries. For more information on these tools, check out the [Ray docs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-overview/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "See the instructions in the [README](./README.md) for setting up your environment to use this tutorial."
